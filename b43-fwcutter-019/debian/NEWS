   b43-fwcutter does not install the firmwares itself anymore. The
   question for it is gone. Install the packages which suits your needs:
   - firmware-b43-installer
   - firmware-b43legacy-installer

b43-fwcutter (1:011-5) unstable; urgency=high

   This version of the package installs the firmware suitable for kernels
   >= 2.6.25. It will do so unconditionally on upgrades and this break usage
   with 2.6.24. If you for some reason still want to use 2.6.24, please
   backup your "old" /lib/firmware/b43.
